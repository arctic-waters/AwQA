# AwQA - ArcticWaters Queue Application

ArticWaters Queue Application is a hackathon project (prototype) meant to allow simple and effective virtual queue systems to ensure safety protocols of physical locations are being met in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It features a ContourMap application to help location owners map out the physical area of their location and calculate maximum capacity, and a QueueSystem web application server to manage dynamic virtual queues.
This project was written for the XdHacks-Covid hackathon.
